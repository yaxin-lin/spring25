 <p> Cinnamoroll is a white dog who lives at Caf√© Cinnamon. He is friends with Chiffon, Mocha, Espresso, Cappuccino and Milk over there. He fell out of the sky when wandering on the clouds and landed near Cafe Cinnamon. Chowder saw him and Ms. Anna picked Cinnamoroll up. Ms. Anna then introduced him to his new friends, Chiffon, Mocha, Espresso, Cappuccino, and Milk</p>
